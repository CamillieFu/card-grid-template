# Responsive Card Template | React

This repository is a short-and-sweet template for creating a card element in a React app. 
The card element will be generated by iterating over any chosen data (updating of props necessary!)

## Design

The cards are being displaying in a grid container. the number of rows and columns are easily updatable. 
These cards are meant to be image-focused rather than text-heavy.
The card and the image in the card are also fully responsive.
The image size will change fluidly depending on the viewport size. 

### Usage

For quick web design, these cards can be copy and pasted into any React project. The styling is also easily importable, 
as all files are separated neatly (pick and choose!)
